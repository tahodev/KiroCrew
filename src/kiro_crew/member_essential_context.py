    The ROOTS are compared in their realpath spelling; the CANDIDATE is only

    Roots must resolve because ``abspath`` follows no link: a candidate that
    arrived resolved -- as an expanded glob match does -- matches no root whose
    spelling still carries a symlink, which skips this isolation entirely on a
    host whose home is reached through one. A workspace root is configuration,
    but configuration a dashboard caller can write (an absolute ``dir``), so it
    is resolved through the same ``validate_file_path`` screen as everything
    else here (:func:`_comparable_root`): a UNC-shaped root is compared
    lexically instead of being resolved, because ``realpath`` on it would be
    the outbound SMB probe.

    The candidate must NOT resolve, because it can be an unvalidated caller path
    and ``realpath`` on one is itself an outbound probe for a UNC target on
    Windows -- the same reason ``validate_file_path`` screens UNC shapes BEFORE
    resolving anything. Callers that hold a validated path pass it already
    resolved, so those comparisons are exact; ``_read`` additionally re-checks the
    validated path, so the pre-validation call never has to be the deciding one.
